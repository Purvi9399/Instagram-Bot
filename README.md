## Requirements:


- **Add a web driver of your respective browser.**
	- In my case its Chrome.
		> [Download Chrome webdriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)
	- Place the .exe file of your webdriver in the directory where the python.exe exist.
		- _General directory location :- C:\Program Files\Python38 {or which ever python version is installed, Python37 if python 3.7 is installed}._


---------------
## Instruction:

If you don't have the Chrome browser installed, then:

Please read the comments at line 11, 12, 13 of the file "Instagram_bot.py" in "source code" branch
	
Once you are done with the code, run it:

1. It'll ask you to select/add/remove instagram user id.
2. With your chosen id, now you can 
	- Keep a track on your followers/following
		- _It also saves the list in form of .txt file_
	- Spam multiple person with only 3 commands

		
_Note: Please make sure you opt the command/choice in form of numbers(1,2,3,4...), as the numbers will be mentioned in-front of the option_
